    <h1>Wairimu's Graduation Anniversary</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this event is celebrate a year of being an adult. We all know how tough adulting can be hence the
      importance to celebrate. A whole year has passed since graduation. A lot has happened in the course of the past
      year and I would like to celebrate all the accomplishments, lessons learnt and even mistakes done together with
      the people who matter. I have grown and experienced moments I will live to remember. This is just but the
      beginning of many more celebrations.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ad numquam
